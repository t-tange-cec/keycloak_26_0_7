= LDAP users are created as enabled by default when using Microsoft Active Directory

If you are using Microsoft AD and creating users through the administrative interfaces, the user will created as enabled by default.

In previous versions, it was only possible to update the user status after setting a (non-temporary) password to the user.
This behavior was not consistent with other built-in user storages as well as not consistent with others LDAP vendors supported
by the LDAP provider.
